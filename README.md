# Setup
The setup below works on a UNIX like system. Windows should work in a similar fashion. Just give it a quick google.
```bash
python3 -m venv <directory name>
source <directory name>/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

# Start the server:
```
python3 run.py
```
Then navigate to localhost:5000 to see the game. You can start playing by hitting one of the arrow keys.
